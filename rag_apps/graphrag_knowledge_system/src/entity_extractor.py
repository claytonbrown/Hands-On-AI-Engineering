Analyze the text and extract ALL significant entities and relationships.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
  "entities": [
    {{
      "name": "Exact entity name, properly capitalized",
      "type": "PERSON|ORGANIZATION|LOCATION|CONCEPT|EVENT|TECHNOLOGY|PRODUCT|OTHER",
      "description": "Detailed description based on what the text says about this entity"

      "description": "Precise description of the relationship between source and target",
      "weight": 0.8
    }}
  ]
}}

Extraction rules:
- Extract 3–12 meaningful, specific entities; skip generic words
- Every relationship source and target MUST be an entity you extracted
- weight is 0.0–1.0 reflecting relationship strength or importance
- Return only valid JSON, no markdown fences, no extra text
