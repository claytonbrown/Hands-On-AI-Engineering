## Overview

An AI-powered portfolio analysis agent that evaluates stock holdings using live market data. Enter your tickers, share counts, and average purchase prices, and the agent fetches real-time pricing and fundamentals via YFinance, searches for recent news via DuckDuckGo, and generates a comprehensive portfolio review, streamed live in the UI as it builds.

The report covers P&L per position, portfolio-level metrics, concentration and valuation risk flags, sector breakdown, and specific rebalancing recommendations.

## Features

- **Live Market Data:** Fetches real-time prices, fundamentals, and analyst ratings via YFinance for every holding
- **P&L Calculations:** Unrealized gain/loss per position (absolute and percentage) plus portfolio totals
- **Risk Assessment:** Flags concentration risk (positions > 20%), valuation extremes (P/E > 40), and negative news sentiment
- **Sector Breakdown:** Visualizes portfolio weight across sectors to identify diversification gaps
- **Rebalancing Recommendations:** Specific, data-driven suggestions on what to trim, hold, or add
- **Streaming Output:** Analysis streams in real time as the agent works through each holding
- **Pre-loaded Example Portfolio:** A 7-stock portfolio is ready to analyze on first launch
- **Quick Question Buttons:** One-click common analysis queries in the sidebar
